Project outline
===============
[project_outline]

This file is the entry point for the Arc project, undertaken to complete
preliminary work on the Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) dataset
introduced in "On the Measure of Intelligence" (Francois Chollet 2019:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547). In particular the MIL problems
defined in the Arc project are meant to establish what the ARC
dataset calls "objectness priors", which in MIL terms means background
knowledge of what constitutes an object and its properties.

Arc comprises a number of separate experiment files, each defining a
particular task in an image analysis pipeline that, once completed, will
represent an ARC dataset problem as an image transformation problem. The
idea is to analyse the two images comprising an ARC problem, find their
differences and find a plan to transform the input image to the output
image. Individual tasks are either hand-crafted Prolog programs, or MIL
problems set up to learn classic AI representations, such as grammars
and plans.

Fundamental assumptions
=======================
[fundamental_assumptions]

The image representation and backround knowledge defined for this
experiment file (and in the accompanying source files) embodies a set of
assumptions about objects and their properties. These assumptions are
stated explicitly below.


1. Object cohesion

   "An object is a set of contiguous cells of the same colour".

   This assumption follows directly from the ARC dataset's first
   "objectness prior", i.e. object cohesion based on spatial and colour
   continuity.

2. Orientation bias

   "Cells in images are ordered left-to-right and top-to-bottom"

   A strict ordering bias is imposed on the representation of images and
   the objectes therein. An image is a Cartesian plane flipped about the
   x axis, i.e. a square grid with the origin at (0,0) and a limit at
   (x,y), where x and y are the width and height dimensions of the
   image.

   Cells comprising an object are ordered according to their appearance
   in the image grid, so that the first cell of an object is the one
   closest to the origin and the last the one closest to its limit.

   This assumption is enforced by the image segmentation code in
   image.pl, specifically image_scan/2.

3. Background concept

   "The background of an image is itself an object (or more than one)".

   Some ARC tasks require the background of an image to be manipulated
   and transformed so a concept of "background" is likely to be useful.
   The background of an image is composed of cells of the same colour
   and is divided into contiguous sub-objects (i.e. regions) surrounding
   foreground objects.

   This assumption too follows from the ARC dataset's first objectness
   prior, which includes the ability to parse an image into zones.

4. Properties of objects

   "Objects have distinct shapes and colours".

   The most important property of an object is that it can described in
   terms of its shape. The second most important property is that it can
   be described in terms of its colour. This is an immediate consequence
   of the first fundamental assumption.

5. Shapes are made of lines

   "In a two-dimensional grid, each shape is composed of straight
   lines".

   Every shape that can be represented in a two-dimensional grid can be
   represented by a suitable arrangment of single-width lines drawn
   between two points on the grid.

   Background knowledge defined in this experiment file describes
   elementary line types such as vertical lines, horizontal lines,
   single points, etc. These low-level elements are used to construct
   more complex objects, such as squares, rectangles, and so on.

6. Object relations
   "An Image is a set of objects participating in relations".

    An image is a _gestalt_ of objects relating to each other in a
    specific manner. Two images are different not only because they
    contain different objects with different properties but also because
    the objects in each image are in different relations with each
    other.


Learning representations
------------------------
[learning_representations]

For every concept that must be reprsented to solve the problems in the
ARC dataset, the decision has to be made of whether to learn it or
whether to provide a representation of the concept already hand-crafted.
This is in particular the case with respect to background knowledge,
which is the set of building blocks of ARC problem solutions we hope to
provide.

In general, we choose to learn representations of a concept if the
concept is likely to have many variants. Otherwise, we hand-craft
a representation of a concept.

For example, we provide hand-crafted definitions of grammar productions
representing a vertical line, to be used as background knowledge for the
task of learning line segmentation grammars. The concept of a "vertical
line" never changes, in any image, for any object: it is always a line
oriented from north to south. On the other hand, the concept of a set of
line segments comprising an object changes substantially depending on
the shape of the object. Accordingly, we learn line segmentation
grammars from examples, rather than hand-craft them.

Note that what changes and what remains the same itself depends on the
bedrock of fundamental assumptions we make about an image. For example,
the concept of a vertical line depends on the orientation bias and our
representation of the cardinal and ordinal directions in an image as
hand-crafted background knowledge. It wouldn't make sense to describe a
vertical line in terms of direction, unless we had already defined the
concept of directions- or, attempted to learn it. However, the concept
of direction is itself unchanging so there is no need to learn it from
scratch.


Progress so far
===============
[current_progress]

In Summary
----------

For the time being we are concentrating on learning representations of
an object's shape in the fomr of a grammar and a plan describing how to
draw the shape as a set of contiguous lines (and points).

More analytically
-----------------

The most important properties of an object are its shape and colour. The
colour of an object can easily be found by looking at any of its cells.
Representing an object's shape, for objects of arbitrary shapes, is more
complicated. The purpose of the work done so far is to teach Louise
representations of objects' shapes.

In short, we teach Louise to represent an object's shape in two steps.

In the first step, a "line segmentation grammar" is learned that shows
how an object is composed of vertical and horizontal lines or single
points.

Line segmentation grammars analyse an object into its component lines,
but do not explain how those lines are articulated to compose the
object's shape. The former task is handled by the second step, a "shape
drawing plan", composed of read and write operations that move a
"read/write head" over the shape, writing lines and points as required.

The two tasks are defined separately as two experiment files,
line_segmentation.pl and shape_drawing.pl, each with its own background
knowledge. The line segmentation grammars learned from the MIL problems
defined in line_segmentation.pl are added to the BK of shape_drawing.pl.

From grammars to languages and from plans to strategies
-------------------------------------------------------

Line segmentation grammars and shape drawing plans can be learned in two
configurations, depending on the type of examples. Examples of objects
of a single shape can be used to learn segmentation grammars and drawing
plans for objects of that specific shape. Examples of objects of mixed
shapes can be used to learn generic segmentation grammars and plans, for
objects of any shape represented in the examples (and probably some
combinations thereof not directly represented in the examples as a
result of generalisation).

To distinguish between the two configurations, we call a generic line
segmentation grammar a line segmentation "language" and a generic shape
drawing plan a shape drawing "strategy". Individual shapes' grammars and
plans can be learned from fewer examples and can be expected to be
smaller in size, while generic languages and plans will grow in size and
generality with the number of examples. We expect generic languages and
strategies to end up being quite large- but for the purposes of the ARC
dataset smaller grammars and plans will probably suffice.

Comments on current progress
----------------------------

The first task in the pipeline, learning line segmentation grammars, is
relatively easy and requires relatively few background predicates.

The second task, learning shape drawing plans is a bit trickier and
requires more background knowledge to represent read/write operations.
Currently only simple line and square shapes are learned, mostly because
the BK defined so far is not sufficient to learn anything more (or
invent the missing BK).

It is interesting to note that a line segmentation grammar provides
_some_ information about the articulation of the component lines of an
object. That is thanks to the very strong orientation bias imposed by
the hand-crafted object extraction code in image.pl. It is certainly
possible to reproduce a specific object of a given shape given only a
line segmentation grammar that can successfully recognise the object, by
examining the parsed lines in the object to find out the starting cell
for each such line. However, this representation will not generalise
very well to arbitrary objects of a given shape. Drawing plans, learned
from sufficiently varied examples, should not have this over-specific
problem.

Note also that it is possible to learn a _grammar_ to represent a
drawing plan. However, such a grammar would have productions with a very
complex structure, to represent the relevant components of the drawing
program's state. While Louise _can_ learn such a grammar, setting up a
MIL problem to learn it would require defining by hand very specific
metarules and extensive background knowledge. This is something that we
would like to avoid - in general, we want to keep the hand-crafting of
background knowledge and metarueles to a minimum.
